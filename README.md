# Topic_Extraction_using_Top2Vec
The project aims to perform topic extraction using the Top2Vec algorithm, which is a powerful technique for topic modeling and document clustering. It utilizes the top2vec library in Python to train a model on the 20 newsgroups dataset and extract meaningful topics from the documents.

# Installation
To run the code in this repository, please follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

**pip install top2vec[sentence_encoders]**

# Usage

Open the Topic_Extraction_using_Top2Vec.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter notebook environment or any Python IDE.

Ensure that you have an internet connection to fetch the 20 newsgroups dataset.

Execute the code cells step-by-step to perform the following tasks:

**1 -** Training a Top2Vec model on the 20 newsgroups dataset.
**2 -** Extracting topic information such as topic sizes, topic numbers, and topic keywords.
**3 -** Generating word clouds for specific topics.
**4 -** Searching for topics related to specific keywords and retrieving topic words and scores.
**5 -** Searching documents related to a specific topic and displaying document texts, scores, and IDs.
**6 -** Performing hierarchical topic reduction to obtain a reduced topic mapping.
**7 -** Retrieving reduced topic words for specific topics.
